# React Portfolio

## Description

Everyone needs a portfolio! This application is meant to showcase the work I have created and provide some more info about me. 

Developing this application allowed me to learn a lot more about react as well as Material UI, and how to build an effective single page application. 

## Installation

To review and work on the code on your own machine clone the repo down and open in your favorite code editor. And remember to npm install so you have all the needed packages. 

## Usage

This application will showcase the various information about the user including: a blurb about them, their previous work, their resume, and a way to contact them through a form.
